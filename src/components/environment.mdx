# API environment

Before you start making API calls, it is important to understand the Snappi landscape. {{ className: 'lead' }}


- <strong>Base API Endpoint</strong>

   The base API endpoint varies depending on the environment. Use the appropriate endpoint for successful API calls. The base API endpoint is the starting point for all API calls. It consists of the root URL for the API, followed by the service and endpoint you want to interact with.

   ```bash {{ title: 'Dynamic Base URL structure' }}
   {ENVIRONMENT}/v1/{endpoint}
   ```  


Base Snappi API endpoint:

<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="UAT">

- <strong>UAT environment</strong>

    
   <Note> 
   This is the User Acceptance Testing environment, primarily used for testing new features before pushing them to production.
   </Note>


   ```bash {{ title: 'Pay Later (UAT)' }}
   merchantbnplapi.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (UAT)' }}
   psd2api.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

</EnvironmentSpecificContent> 


<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="UAT,PROD"> 

- <strong>Sandbox environment</strong>

   <Note>
   A safe testing space for experimenting with API integrations without affecting live data.
   </Note>

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (Sandbox)' }}
   psd2api.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

</EnvironmentSpecificContent> 


<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD">

<Note> 
For the <strong>Production</strong> environment, only the <strong>Sandbox</strong> is currently available.
</Note>
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>

<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD">

- <strong>Production environment</strong>

   <Note>
   The live environment for real data interactions.
   </Note>

   ```bash {{ title: 'Pay Later (Production)' }}
   merchantbnplapi.snappibank.com
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (Production)' }}
   psd2api.snappibank.com
   ```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>      

<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="UAT">
For example, if you are working in the <strong>UAT</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:

```bash {{ title: 'UAT' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com.gr/v1/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>

<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD">
For example, if you are working in the <strong>Production</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:

```bash {{ title: 'Production' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com/v1/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>

{/*
<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD"> 
For example, if you are working in the <strong>PROD</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:


```bash {{ title: 'PRODUCTION' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com/v1/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>

<Note>
By structuring your API calls this way, you can easily switch between environments.
