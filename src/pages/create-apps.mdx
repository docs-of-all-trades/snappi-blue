# Create applications

The Snappi developers portal allows you to integrate your platform with snappi and enable e-commerce and payment functionality. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Creating applications is the first step for you to set up this integration. 


Let's walk you through the steps of creating an application:

<Steps>
  <Step number={1} title="Log into your developers portal account">
    Log in with your username and password.
    <div className="mt-4">
      <Image 
        src="/landing-page.webp" 
        alt="Developers portal" 
        width={800} 
        height={600} 
        sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"
      />
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Click Create App">
    Click the **Create App** button. Launch the application creation process.
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Select Application Type">
    Choose the type of application you wish to create. 
    <div className="mt-4">
      <Image 
        src="/select-app-type-crop.webp" 
        alt="Developers portal" 
        width={600} 
        height={400} 
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 400px"
      />
    </div>    
    
    
    Available options:

    - <strong>Merchant App</strong>: for standard merchant applications.
    - <strong>Merchant App - Sandbox</strong>: a sandbox version, used for testing without impacting live systems.
    - <strong>PSD2 App</strong>: for applications compliant with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), which is necessary for secure online payments and open banking.


  </Step>

  <Step number={4} title="Edit your application's data settings">

    Fill in the required fields for the application you are creating.

    <strong>Merchant App / Merchant App - Sandbox</strong>:

    <div className="mt-4">
      <Image 
        src="/merchant-app-data-settings-crop.webp" 
        alt="Developers portal" 
        width={400} 
        height={200} 
        sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 200px"
      />
    </div>

      - `Application name`: the name of the application being created.
        <Important>
        Enter a unique name for your application in the provided field. This is how your application appears in the portal and also on reports.
        </Important>
      - `Application description`: a brief description of the application’s purpose or functionality.
      - `Success Callback URL`: the URL used to notify your application when a transaction is successfully completed. The <strong>{`{orderIdentifier}`}</strong> placeholder can be replaced dynamically with the actual order identifier to track specific transactions.
      - `Fail Callback URL`: the URL used to notify your application when a transaction fails. The <strong>{`{orderIdentifier}`}</strong> placeholder allows tracking of failed transactions by order.
      - `Success Redirect URL`: after a successful transaction, you will be redirected to this URL. It often leads to a confirmation or thank-you page on your website.
      - `Fail Redirect URL`: this URL redirects you after a transaction failure, typically taking you to an error page or providing further instructions on how to proceed.

    <strong>PSD2 App</strong>:

    <div className="mt-4">
      <Image 
        src="/psd2-app-data-settings-crop.webp" 
        alt="Developers portal" 
        width={500} 
        height={300} 
        sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 300px"
      />
    </div>    

      - `Application name`: the name assigned to the PSD2 application.
      - `Application description`: a brief description outlining the application’s features or use case.
      - `Certificate`: upload an eIDAS (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) certificate, which is crucial for ensuring secure communications and compliance with digital identity regulations.
      - `Redirect URI`: specify the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) where the application will redirect users after certain actions, such as consents or payments.

      * <strong>Account information</strong>: enable access to account information services, allowing the application to retrieve account details.

      * <strong>Payment initiation</strong>: enable payment initiation services, allowing the application to initiate payments.

      * <strong>Funds confirmation</strong>: enable funds confirmation services, allowing the application to confirm the availability of funds.
