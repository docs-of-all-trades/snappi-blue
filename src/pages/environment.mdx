# API environment

Before you start making API calls, it is important to understand the Snappi landscape. {{ className: 'lead' }}


<strong>Base API Endpoint</strong>: The base API endpoint varies depending on the environment. Use the appropriate endpoint for successful API calls. 
   


<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="UAT">

<strong>UAT environment</strong>: This is the User Acceptance Testing environment, primarily used for testing new features before pushing them to production.


   ```bash {{ title: 'Pay Later (UAT)' }}
   merchantbnplapi.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (UAT)' }}
   psd2api.snappibank.com.gr
   ```


<strong>Sandbox environment</strong>: A safe testing space for experimenting with API integrations without affecting live data.

   ```bash {{ title: 'Pay Later (Sandbox)' }}
   bnpl-sandbox.snappibank.com.gr/
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (Sandbox)' }}
   psd2api.sandbox.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

For example, if you are working in the <strong>UAT</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:

```bash {{ title: 'UAT' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com.gr/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent> 

<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD"> 

<strong>Sandbox environment</strong>: A safe testing space for experimenting with API integrations without affecting live data.


   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (Sandbox)' }}
   psd2api.sandbox.snappibank.com.gr
   ```

<Note> 
For the <strong>Production</strong> environment, only the <strong>Sandbox</strong> is currently available.
</Note>


<strong>Production environment</strong>: The live environment for real data interactions.

   ```bash {{ title: 'Pay Later (Production)' }}
   merchantbnplapi.snappibank.com
   ```

   ```bash {{ title: 'PSD2 (Production)' }}
   psd2api.snappibank.com
   ```

   For example, if you are working in the <strong>Production</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:

```bash {{ title: 'Production' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent>      



{/*
<EnvironmentSpecificContent environment="PROD"> 
For example, if you are working in the <strong>PROD</strong> environment and want to interact with the <strong>PSD2</strong> service, your <strong>Base URL</strong> would be:


```bash {{ title: 'PRODUCTION' }}
https://psd2api.snappibank.com/v1/
```
</EnvironmentSpecificContent> 
*/}
{/*
<Note>
By structuring your API calls this way, you can easily switch between environments.
