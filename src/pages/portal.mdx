The <strong>Snappi developers portal</strong> is an online interface that allows third parties and snappi Merchants to register their applications to snappi and start using the APIs in Sandbox and Production Enviroments.
Accessing the platform gives the ability to:

- Register Merchant Application or PSD2 Application

- Receive Subscription keys for each app


<Note>
  The portal is currently in beta. If you are a merchant or a developer that builds merchant e-shops or payment gateways, reach out to snappi at <a href="mailto:support@snappibank.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@snappibank.com</a> and they will provide you with a new account.
